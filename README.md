To download this plug-in, you can download the latest release from the [releases gage](https://github.com/junghyun397/JustSkyblock/releases) and the latest build version from [ActionsCI](https://github.com/junghyun397/JustSkyblock/actions). The master branch is developed in PowerNukkit API, and NukkitX API version is developed in nukkitx branch. The nukkitx branch is updated when a new version is released.

### Install Resource Pack
JustSkyblock is completed with a Resource Pack. Put ``JustSkyblock_Resource_Pack.mcpack`` file in the ``resource_packs`` folder to applying the Resource Pack. Resource Pack works seamlessly regardless of the block id used by Resource Block, and only supports up to LV5 Resource Block.

2. Set the ``allow-nether`` option in server.properties file to ``off``, In the default settings, one of Resource Block use netherack block id.

### Additional plugins
JustSkyblock is built without considering being used with other plug-ins. Applying other plug-ins, especially those with teleport or block management, is not validated and cannot guarantee fully operation. If you need to apply other plug-ins additionally, please avoid plug-ins with teleport or block management functions as much as possible.
